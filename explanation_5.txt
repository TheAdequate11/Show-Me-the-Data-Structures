The data structured used was a linked list since it is similar to the idea of a blockchain.
Each block contains information about the transaction, the hash, timestamp, the previous block's
hash, and the next block in the linked list. The time complexity of implementing a new block
is O(1) since it is simply appended to the tail of the linked list. The space complexity
is O(n) since the linked list only contains the number of blocks input by the user.
