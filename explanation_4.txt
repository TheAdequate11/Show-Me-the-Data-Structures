The 'Group' object resembles a tree; and look ups in unsorted trees are limited
to linear time complexity O(n): in the worst case scenario all items must be
visited. Therefore, the time complexity for this algorithm is O(n). The
lookup function 'is_user_in_group' is recursive as I found this was the
simplest solution to the problem. The space complexity of the algorithm is
O(log(n)) since the recursive function performs a depth-first search and the call
stack will only contain a branch worth of items in memory at one time.
